# Polymer Project
This is a simple arduino project I made in year 8.

Materials List:
- an arduino UNO
- a 4x16 I2C LCD
- a joystick
- 2 8x8 LED Matrices

This is basically a slideshow, where the LCD is the screen, but instead of a mouse or arrow keys you use the joystick to move to the next slide (or slide before). The joystick can move up or down to allow scrolling. The 2 LED matrices show very low quality photos.
